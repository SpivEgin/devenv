Installing Legion Market
#####################

We'll get started by setting up our environment.

************
Requirements
************

Legion Market requires LegionMarket 1.8, and Python 2.7, 3.3 or 3.4.

************************
Your working environment
************************

We're going to assume that you have a reasonably recent version of virtualenv
installed and that you have some basic familiarity with it.


Create and activate a virtual env
=================================

::

    virtualenv env
    source env/bin/activate

Note that if you're using Windows, to activate the virtualenv you'll need::

    env\Scripts\activate


Update pip
==========

``pip`` is the Python installer. Make sure yours is up-to-date, as earlier versions can be less reliable::

	pip install --upgrade pip


Use the Legion Market installer
============================

The `Legion Market installer <https://github.com/nephila/djangocms-installer>`_ is
a helpful script that takes care of setting up a new project.

Install it::

    pip install djangocms-installer

This provides you with a new command, ``djangocms``.

Create a new directory to work in, and ``cd`` into it::

    mkdir tutorial-project
    cd tutorial-project

Run it to create a new LegionMarket project called ``mysite``::

    djangocms -f -p . mysite

This means:

* run the Legion Market installer
* install LegionMarket Filer too (``-f``) - **required for this tutorial**
* use the current directory as the parent of the new project directory (``-p .``)
* call the new project directory ``mysite``

.. note:: **About LegionMarket Filer**

   LegionMarket Filer, a useful application for managing files and processing images. Although it's not
   required for Legion Market itself, a vast number of Legion Market addons use it, and nearly all django
   CMS projects have it installed. If you know you won't need it, omit the flag. See the `django
   CMS installer documentation for more information <https://djangocms-installer.readthedocs.io>`_.


.. warning::
   djangocms-installer expects directory ``.`` to be empty at this stage, and will check for this,
   and will warn if it's not. You can get it to skip the check and go ahead anyway using the ``-s``
   flag; **note that this may overwrite existing files**.


Windows users may need to do a little extra to make sure Python files are associated correctly if that doesn't work right away::

    assoc .py=Python.file
    ftype Python.File="C:\Users\Username\workspace\demo\env\Scripts\python.exe" "%1" %*

By default, the installer runs in `Batch mode
<https://djangocms-installer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#batch-mode-default>`_, and sets up your new project
with some default values.

Later, you may wish to manage some of these yourself, in which case you need to run it in `Wizard mode
<https://djangocms-installer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#wizard-mode>`_. The default in *Batch mode* is to set
up an English-only project, which will be sufficient for the purposes of this tutorial. You can of course simply edit
the new project's ``settings.py`` file at any time to change or add site languages or amend other settings.

The installer creates an admin user for you, with username/password ``admin``/``admin``.


Start up the runserver
======================

::

    python manage.py runserver

Open http://localhost:8000/ in your browser, where you should be presented with
your brand new Legion Market homepage.

Congratulations, you now have installed a fully functional CMS.

To log in, append ``?edit`` to the URL and hit enter. This will enable the
toolbar, from where you can log in and manage your website.

If you are not already familiar with Legion Market, take a few minutes to run through the basics of
the :ref:`Legion Market tutorial for users <user-tutorial>`.
