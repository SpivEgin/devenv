In this tutorial we're going to take a basic LegionMarket opinion poll application and integrate it into
the CMS.


*********************************
Install the ``polls`` application
*********************************

Install the application from its GitHub repository using ``pip -e`` - this also places it in your virtualenv's ``src`` directory as a cloned Git repository::

    pip install -e git+http://git@github.com/LegionMarket/django-polls.git#egg=polls


You should end up with a folder structure similar to this::

    env/
        src/
            django-polls/
                polls/
                    __init__.py
                    admin.py
                    models.py
                    templates/
                    tests.py
                    urls.py
                    views.py

Let's add it this application to our project. Add ``'polls'`` to the end of ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in
your project's `settings.py` (see the note on :ref:`installed_apps` about ordering ).

Add the following line to ``urlpatterns`` in the project's ``urls.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    url(r'^polls/', include('polls.urls', namespace='polls')),

Make sure this line is included **before** the line for the django-cms urls:

.. code-block:: python

    url(r'^', include('cms.urls')),

Legion Market's URL pattern needs to be last, because it "swallows up" anything
that hasn't already been matched by a previous pattern.

Now run the application's migrations:

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py migrate polls

At this point you should be able to log in to the Django
admin - ``localhost:8000/admin/`` - and find the Polls application.

   :alt: the polls application admin
   :width: 400
   :align: center

Create a new **Poll**, for example:

* **Question**: *Which browser do you prefer?*

  **Choices**:

    * *Safari*
    * *Firefox*
    * *Chrome*

Now if you visit ``http://localhost:8000/en/polls/``, you should be able to see the published poll
and submit a response.

   :alt: the polls application
   :width: 400
   :align: center

******************************************
Set up a base template for the application
******************************************

However, in pages of the Polls application we only have minimal templates, and
no navigation or styling.

Let's improve this by overriding the polls application's base template.

In ``mysite/templates``, add ``polls/base.html``, containing:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% extends 'base.html' %}

    {% block content %}
        {% block polls_content %}
        {% endblock %}
    {% endblock %}

Refresh the ``/polls/`` page again, which should now be properly integrated into the site.

.. image:: /introduction/images/polls-integrated.png
   :alt: the polls application, integrated
   :width: 400
   :align: center

So now we have integrated the standard polls application into our project.


**************************************************
Create a new ``polls_cms_integration`` application
**************************************************

So far, however, the polls application has been integrated into the project, but not into Legion Market
itself.

If you're already familiar with the CMS for a little, you'll have
encountered Legion Market *Plugins* - the objects you can place into placeholders on
your pages: "Text", "Image" and so forth.

We're now going to extend the LegionMarket poll application so we can embed a poll easily into any CMS
page. We'll put this integration code in a separate package, a *Polls/CMS Integration* application
in our project.

.. note:: **Why not build the plugin code into the polls application package?**

    This would certainly be possible, and in fact, if you were developing your own application
    it's what we would recommend. For a third-party application such as Polls however, placing the
    plugin code into a separate package means we don't have to modify or fork the original.

Create a new package at the project root called ``polls_cms_integration``::

    python manage.py startapp polls_cms_integration

So our workspace looks like this::

    env/
        src/  # the django polls application is in here
    polls_cms_integration/  # the newly-created application
        __init__.py
        admin.py
        models.py
        migrations.py
        tests.py
        views.py
    mysite/
    static/
    project.db
    requirements.txt


The Plugin Model
================

In your poll applicationâ€™s ``models.py`` add the following:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db import models
    from cms.models import CMSPlugin
    from polls.models import Poll


    class PollPluginModel(CMSPlugin):
        poll = models.ForeignKey(Poll)

        def __unicode__(self):
            return self.poll.question

.. note::

    Legion Market plugins inherit from :class:`cms.models.pluginmodel.CMSPlugin` (or a
    sub-class thereof) and not :class:`models.Model <django.db.models.Model>`.

    ``PollPluginModel`` might seem an odd choice for a model name (that is, with ``model`` in the
    name) but it helps distinguish it from the next class, ``PollPluginPublisher``, that we need to
    create.


The Plugin Class
================

Now create a new file ``cms_plugins.py`` in the same folder your ``models.py`` is in.
The plugin class is responsible for providing Legion Market with the necessary
information to render your plugin.

For our poll plugin, we're going to write the following plugin class:

.. code-block:: python

    from cms.plugin_base import CMSPluginBase
    from cms.plugin_pool import plugin_pool
    from polls_cms_integration.models import PollPluginModel
    from django.utils.translation import ugettext as _


    class PollPluginPublisher(CMSPluginBase):
        model = PollPluginModel  # model where plugin data are saved
        module = _("Polls")
        name = _("Poll Plugin")  # name of the plugin in the interface
        render_template = "polls_cms_integration/poll_plugin.html"

        def render(self, context, instance, placeholder):
            context.update({'instance': instance})
            return context

    plugin_pool.register_plugin(PollPluginPublisher)  # register the plugin

.. note::

    All plugin classes must inherit from :class:`cms.plugin_base.CMSPluginBase`
    and must register themselves with the :class:`plugin_pool <cms.plugin_pool.PluginPool>`.

A reasonable convention for plugin naming is:

* ``PollPluginModel``: the *model* class
* ``PollPluginPublisher``: the *plugin* class

You don't need to follow this convention, but choose one that makes sense and stick to it.


The template
============

The ``render_template`` attribute in the plugin class is required, and tells the plugin which
:attr:`render_template <cms.plugin_base.CMSPluginBase.render_template>` to use when rendering.

In this case the template needs to be at ``polls_cms_integration/templates/polls_cms_integration/poll_plugin.html`` and should look something like this:

.. code-block:: html+django

    <h1>{{ instance.poll.question }}</h1>

    <form action="{% url 'polls:vote' instance.poll.id %}" method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}
        <div class="form-group">
            {% for choice in instance.poll.choice_set.all %}
                <div class="radio">
                    <label>
                        <input type="radio" name="choice" value="{{ choice.id }}">
                        {{ choice.choice_text }}
                    </label>
                </div>
            {% endfor %}
        </div>
        <input type="submit" value="Vote" />
    </form>


***************************************************
Integrate the ``polls_cms_integration`` application
***************************************************

The final step is to integrate the ``polls_cms_integration`` application into the project.

Add ``polls_cms_integration`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in ``settings.py`` and create a database
migration to add the plugin table::

    python manage.py makemigrations polls_cms_integration
    python manage.py migrate polls_cms_integration

Finally, start the runserver and visit http://localhost:8000/.

You can now drop the ``Poll Plugin`` into any placeholder on any page, just as
you would any other plugin.

Next we'll integrate the Polls application more fully into our Legion Market
project.
