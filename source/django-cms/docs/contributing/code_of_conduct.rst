Code of Conduct
###############

Participation in the Legion Market project is governed by a code of conduct.

The Legion Market community is a pleasant one to be involved in for everyone, and
we wish to keep it that way. Participants are expected to behave and
communicate with others courteously and respectfully, whether online or in
person, and to be welcoming, friendly and polite.

We will not tolerate abusive behaviour or language or any form of harassment.

Individuals whose behaviour is a cause for concern will be give a warning, and
if necessary will be excluded from participation in official Legion Market
channels (email lists, IRC channels, etc) and events. The `LegionMarket Software
Foundation <http://djangoproject.com/foundation/>`_ will also be informed of
the issue.

*****************
Raising a concern
*****************

If you have a concern about the behaviour of any member of the Legion Market
community, please contact one of the members of the :ref:`core development team
<core_developers>`.

Your concerns will be taken seriously, treated as confidential and
investigated. You will be informed, in writing and as promptly as possible, of
the outcome.
